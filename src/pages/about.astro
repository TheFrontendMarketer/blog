      I'm Mike, and I like to nerd out about <br /> marketing and front-end development
    </h2>

      When I'm not marketing 9-5, I spend my free time learning new skills
      (usually early mornings with a cup of coffee). I started my coding journey
      in 2019 and I love the fact that AI is making coding even easier for
      newbies like myself to build projects and apps faster than ever before.
      I'm constantly exploring new tools to help me build amazing things for the
      web and marketing.
      <br /><br />
      Part of the reason I started this blog, like many others, was to put what I've
      been learning to good use. I believe in project based learning rather than just
      watching someone build something on YouTube. Basically, I don't want to just
      read about something, I want to build and put my new skills to work! That’s
      why I decided to develop
      <span class="font-bold">this blog with Astro</span> and document my journey
      as a digital marketer and web developer enthusiast.
      <br /><br />
      Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, I hope you'll find something here
      to inspire your own growth and projects.
      <br /><br />
      Thanks so much for stopping by!
